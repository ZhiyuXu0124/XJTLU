# Coursework 1: M/M/m Queueing System Simulation
In this assignment, you will run a series of simulations for M/M/m queueing system and compare their
average delays. For your reference, a report for a sample simulation of M/M/1 queueing system with
source code, a batch file for its execution, and a plotting script is provided in the appendix.

You should take the sample code of M/M/1 queueing system, generalise it for M/M/m queueing system,
carry out a series of simulations for the parameter values given below, and compare the results for the
average delay (by plotting a chart). For the calculation of the average delay in the simulation, refer to the
sample report and the source code.
